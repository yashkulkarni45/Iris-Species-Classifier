# Iris-Species-Classifier
- This model predicts what species an Iris flower belongs to, the option being setosa, versicolor or virginica. 
- I used the Decision Tree Algorithm to predict the same. 
- Also I compared the accuracy of Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression with Decision tree.
- The model was loaded onto a webpage too, using a Python framework called Flask.
